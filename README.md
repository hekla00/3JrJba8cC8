# Hacker News Redesign

## Overview
This project is a redesigned version of Hacker News, built using React. It uses the Hacker News API to fetch and display posts in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## Features
- Toggle between "new" and "top" posts.
- Pagination for loading more posts.
- Responsive design.
- Automated tests for key components and functionality.

## Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Written using Jest and React Testing Library for individual components.

## Assumptions
- Posts are displayed in a simple list layout.
- Only implemented new and top posts even though the original site had many more.
- Used Tailwind CSS for clean and easy to use UI. 
- Used React.js as the JavaScript framework.
- Tailwind and React were chosen due to prior experience. 
- Tried to keep the UI minimalistic due to the nature of the original site.
- Improved the UI but tried to keep a similar user experience as the original site.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
